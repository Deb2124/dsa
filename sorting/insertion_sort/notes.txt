Imagine we have a row of books of different heights, and we want to sort them from shortest to tallest. Here's how insertion sort works:

- Start with the first book: Assume the first book on the shelf is already sorted.
- Pick the next book: Take the next book in the row.
- Compare and shift: Compare this book with the books that are already sorted. Move the sorted books to the right one by one until you find the correct spot for the new book.
- Insert the book: Place the new book in its correct position.
- Repeat: Repeat the process for each book in the row until all books are sorted.

Here's a step-by-step example with book heights represented by numbers:

Original order: 5, 3, 8, 4, 2

First pass (5): The first book (5) is already sorted.
    Sorted part: 5
    Unsorted part: 3, 8, 4, 2

Second pass (3): Take the next book (3) and find its correct position.
    Compare 3 with 5. Since 3 is smaller, move 5 to the right.
    Insert 3 in the first position.
    Sorted part: 3, 5
    Unsorted part: 8, 4, 2

Third pass (8): Take the next book (8) and find its correct position.
    Compare 8 with 5. Since 8 is larger, it stays in its position.
    Sorted part: 3, 5, 8
    Unsorted part: 4, 2

Fourth pass (4): Take the next book (4) and find its correct position.
    Compare 4 with 8. Since 4 is smaller, move 8 to the right.
    Compare 4 with 5. Since 4 is smaller, move 5 to the right.
    Insert 4 in the correct position.
    Sorted part: 3, 4, 5, 8
    Unsorted part: 2

Fifth pass (2): Take the next book (2) and find its correct position.

    Compare 2 with 8. Since 2 is smaller, move 8 to the right.
    Compare 2 with 5. Since 2 is smaller, move 5 to the right.
    Compare 2 with 4. Since 2 is smaller, move 4 to the right.
    Compare 2 with 3. Since 2 is smaller, move 3 to the right.
    Insert 2 in the correct position.
    Sorted part: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
    Unsorted part: (none)

The books are now sorted from shortest to tallest!
In summary, insertion sort builds the sorted list one item at a time by taking each new book and inserting it into its correct position among the already sorted books.
