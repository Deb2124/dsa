Analogy:

Imagine we have a row of books of different heights, and we want to sort them from shortest to tallest. Here's how bubble sort works in simple terms:

Start at the beginning: Look at the first two books.
Compare and swap: If the first book is taller than the second book, swap them so the shorter one is first.
Move to the next pair: Move to the next pair of books (the second and third books now) and repeat the comparison and swap if needed.
Repeat until the end: Continue this process until you reach the end of the row.
Go back to the start: Once youâ€™ve gone through the whole row, start again from the beginning.
Keep sorting: Repeat this entire process until you can go through the whole row without needing to make any swaps. This means all the books are now sorted from shortest to tallest.
